# 🧠 Intelligent Customer Feedback Analysis System using AI

> An AI-driven solution that analyzes, summarizes, and predicts customer sentiment from feedback collected through emails, chat logs, and social media comments — transforming raw feedback into actionable insights for better decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To **design and develop an AI-based system** capable of:
- Analyzing and classifying customer sentiments (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
- Summarizing lengthy feedback into concise, meaningful overviews
- Predicting future customer satisfaction trends
- Providing an interactive interface for real-time visualization and exploration

---

## 🧩 Project Workflow

### **1️⃣ Data Handling & Preprocessing (25 Marks)**
- Collected/simulated **1,000+ customer feedback records** in `.csv` format  
- Cleaned and prepared data using:
  - Duplicate & noise removal  
  - Tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword removal  
  - Special character handling and normalization  
- **Deliverable:** `data_preprocessing.ipynb` / `data_preprocessing.py`

---

### **2️⃣ Sentiment Classification Model (30 Marks)**
- Implemented advanced NLP-based classification using:
  - **BERT / DistilBERT / LSTM with GloVe embeddings**
- Classified customer feedback into three categories:
  - **Positive**, **Negative**, and **Neutral**
- Evaluated with **Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-Score**
- **Deliverable:** `sentiment_model.ipynb` and saved model `sentiment_model.pkl`

---

### **3️⃣ Text Summarization (20 Marks)**
- Built summarization pipeline using:
  - **Transformer-based models** (T5 / BART) for abstractive summaries  
  - **Extractive method** using TF-IDF + cosine similarity
- Generated:
  - **Short summaries** for quick overviews  
  - **Detailed summaries** for in-depth analysis
- **Deliverable:** `text_summarization.ipynb`

---

### **4️⃣ Predictive Insight Generation (15 Marks)**
- Identified recurring issues and key sentiment patterns  
- Applied **time-series forecasting** (Prophet / ARIMA) to predict:
  - Future sentiment distribution
  - Monthly satisfaction trend
- Visualized insights using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**
- **Deliverable:** `AI_insights_report.pdf`

---

### **5️⃣ Deployment with Streamlit/Flask (10 Marks)**
- Developed an **interactive web app** allowing users to:
  - Upload feedback datasets
  - View real-time sentiment results
  - Display summarization and predictive graphs
- Built using **Streamlit / Flask**, **Plotly**, and **Matplotlib**
- **Deliverable:** Running web app demo and GitHub repository link

---

### **⭐ Bonus Feature (Optional – 10 Marks)**
- Integrated an **AI Chatbot** (OpenAI / Hugging Face) to:
  - Respond to user queries based on summarized feedback  
  - Suggest actionable improvements for customer satisfaction
